Updates to the 1300 Git Repository
=======

- Jan 20: Adding text and video cheat sheets for using Linux and the
  Virtual Box VM. Look in recitations/ for the `command line cheat
  sheet` and `intro to linux videos` files.
  
- Jan 20: Adding the `cs1300.py` script that I used during class. This
  is also in the recitations/ folder.
