> This software is one example of a Virtual Machine (VM). It is a
  program that provides a simulated computer. In this case, the

  hardware. For a VM like this to be useful you need to supply it with
  a VM Image (see the next item).

provided by the CS Department.

> This file specifies a fully functional Ubuntu Linux instance. It is
  huge, so when you start downloading this, expect it to take a
  while. We provide this so everybody has a common computing
  environment. Linux is chosen because it is an incredibly powerful,
  programmer-friendly operating system. The Ubuntu flavor is chosen
  because it is relatively user-friendly.
