Recitations for CS 1300
=========

There may or may not be extra documentation for weekly
recitations. If/when there are files to distribute, we will put them
here.

To do most (all?) of the homeworks, you need to have a development
environment set up. The CS department has a virtual machine that
you can use. See the 'computing environment' document in this folder.

Recitations are opportunities for you to get some personal attention
from your TA, so you can ask questions _and get answers_.
