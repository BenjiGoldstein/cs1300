Hello World
======

"Hello World" is the name we traditionally give to the first program
we write when learning a new programming language. It is the simplest
program imaginable: all it does is displays "Hello World" to the
console.

We don't do this because it is interesting. We do this to demonstrate
that the programming environment is set up correctly, and to convince
ourselves that we can write a program. (Even if that program is very
simple.)

Here is the entire program:

	# this is the Hello World program in Python
	print("Hello, World!")
	
That's it.

Typing that program is not the tricky part. The tricky part is getting
the Python interpreter to run it. 

Lets say that you've saved the above Python program in a file named
"hello.py". From you command line, go to the directory where hello.py
is, and type 'python hello.py'. Like this:

	$ python hello.py

If it prints "Hello World" to the console, everything is working fine.

_(By the way, the dollar sign up there is the conventional way to
indicate the command is typed into the command line interface. Don't
actually type the dollar sign.)_

But what if the program doesn't run?

You might get an error that looks like this:

	-bash: python: command not found
	
If that's the case, it means that Python is either not installed, or
the shell doesn't know where it is. If you are using the VirtualBox
environment, Python should work right away. If you _aren't_ using
VirtBox, unfortunately you are on your own because we can't do tech
support for 500 of you. If you come to the CSEL one of the LAs or TAs
might be around and have a quick fix, though.

Another way of running a python script is to make it executable. There
are two parts to this. First, you have to add the following code _to
the very top of your Python program_ so the whole file looks like
this:

	#!/usr/bin/env python
	print("Hello, World!")

Second, you have to use the command line to change the _mode_ of the
file so that it is executable. This is the command:

	$ chmod +x hello.py

Then you can run the program like this:

	$ ./hello.py

It should print "Hello World!" to the console.

Notice the funny "./" syntax up there. It is needed because the shell
(by default) won't execute programs that are in the current
directory. This is a security precaution. When you type "./" it forces
the shell to look in the directory called ".", which is a special name
for the directory you are in right now.

Go ahead and play around with the print command. You can have your
computer print out pleasant greetings to you by name. Or you can make
your computer print out an expletive-laden rant about your 1300
teacher. 

Turning In Your Homework
=========

__For your homework, the only requirement is that it outputs text to
the console.__

To turn in your assignment, you will use the RetroGrade
system. __Check back here for information on RetroGrade. We are still
getting it set up. We should have something going before next
Tuesday.__

In order for the grading system to work, you will need to make sure
your file is named correctly. You can turn your homework in using
whichever programming language you want. The file names that we accept
are:

For __Python__: hello.py
For __C++__: hello.cpp
For __Java__: hello.java

We've provided simple files with these names. These files contain only
comments. Your job is to write the code that prints stuff to the
console.

Note: only turn in one programming language file at a time.
