Reading Material
==========

There is no required book for this course. Textbooks are absurdly
expensive, and there are a number of high-quality introductory texts
available online.

There are probably thousands of programming languages. For any given
task one language may be superior to another. One of the main goals
for this class is that you learn _how to learn_ programming
languages. Therefore, we will program in not one, not two, but _three_
languages: Python, Java, and C++.

The links below are all extensive texts on these languages. They are
all freely available on the web, but in some cases you can give the
author money if you want a nicer version.
