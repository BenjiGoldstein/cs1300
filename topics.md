Course Purpose 
=======

The purpose of this class is to give everybody involved the
opportunity to learn how to program. This is _not_ a "weed out" class
where we run you through the computer science gauntlet, causing sleep
deprivation or mental anguish. (That comes later.)

No, the goal here is to give everybody the chance to learn how to
program and decide if this is a profession/skill/avocation that they
want to pursue. Computer programming is often seen as an impenetrable
craft practiced exclusively by mad geniuses. _I can assure you this is
not the case._ 

Computer programming, and the more general idea of computational
thinking, is rapidly becoming a basic literacy skill. By the end of
this course (even if you don't continue with more advanced computer
science courses) you should be able to pick up new languages, tools,
technologies, and make them do tricks.

Reading Material
==========

There is no required book for this course. Textbooks are absurdly
expensive, and there are a number of high-quality introductory texts
available online. Learning to program is best done by writing lots and
lots of code. So: I will suggest readings from these books throughout
the course, but _none of it will sink in unless you write code to
convince yourself that you know what you are doing._

There are probably thousands of programming languages. For any given
task one language may be superior to another. One of the main goals
for this class is that you learn _how to learn_ programming
languages. Therefore, we will program in not one, not two, but _three_
languages: Python, Java, and C++. You are encouraged to take it upon
yourself to learn six more. That would be awesome. But it isn't
required.

The links below are all extensive texts on these languages. They are
all freely available on the web, but in some cases you can give the
author money if you want a nicer version.
